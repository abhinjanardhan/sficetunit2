									<br><br>
									<h4>For the Inclusion of IV for KTU Students  - 2018</h4><br>
									
									Protest in College for inclusion of provision for an IV for KTU batch students that has been provided for  the KU batch. As a result the  2015 KTU batch went for IV and permission for the successive batches for the same was provided by the College authorities.

									<br><br>
							<h4>Scaling Down of Series Examinations - 2019</h4> <br>

									<br><br>
									<h4>
										For receiving the Revaluation Refund - 2019 </h4><br>

									<h4>ABOUT SAMSKARA CET</h4><br>
 
									SAMSKARA CET is the cultural wing of SFI CET Unit which is responsible for several cultural events in the Institute around the year. With a view to encouraging young performing artists, the establishment caters regular cultural programmes in all branches of performing arts, like dance, drama, music, etc.
									Though the right to be creative belongs to everyone, the college policies on arts and culture was not in favour of students during the 80’s - this is what gave rise to the SAMSKARA CET. This cultural body was born out of the thirst for freedom, self-expression and rebellion.
									There is an abundance of cultural talent in the college premises and SAMSKARA provides a platform for those talents to flourish. The competitive academic environment and co-curricular activities on campus keep the students on their toes.

									<h4>MATHRUKAM CET Unit</h4> <br>
										There is no force equal to a woman determined to rise, and mathrukam is a group of women determined to rise and help other women rise here at CET. It is the women’s wing of SFI CET Unit and focuses on breaking stereotypes and supporting each other. The wing also reacts on issues and is active at helping women react to the same.
									
									Anjuradh who was the former convener of the unit gave a whole new path for working and encouraged different activities and brought mathrukam out of the box. Looking at past activities, they made a video survey to find out the level of basic sex knowledge in people about periods, sex, virginity, gender identification etc. The results were shocking as most people do not know anything about the same and moreover, myths like how to identify gay people filled the room. 
									
									From there the wing started working on implementing sex education among students by conducting a mathrukam week which was given the title "ഞാൻ തെവിടിശ്ശി" which is a word which most people use to defame a woman and brand her negatively. The name was chosen to speak aloud that we accept the title and that there is nothing bad about people who are given this title.
									
									The mathrukam week was divided into three sections, first  “ ചരക്ക്” representing menstruation and period health and also took steps to supply menstrual cups for free to those who wanted a change from the unhealthy napkins after the session but due to the lockdown they couldn’t deliver it to the students but will be done once the college reopens. The second part was “വെടി” talking about sex and breaking and the third “പടക്കം” was on the point that everyone are same and also was to understand that sexuality is not just limited to male and female and to be proud about your choice. 
									
									The wing organized a photography contest on breaking the stereotypes and the poster gets a special mention by putting a moustache to a woman breaking the normal and had a very good response from Cetians and during lockdown the unit conducted awareness classes and reacted to issues involving patriarchy to break them down.
									
									<br><br><h4>Caricature Challenge </h4><br>
									
									The pandemic and floods have driven the state to an economically weak situation and this is when the unit decided to contribute to the CMDRF by doing something creative. The unit brought together a few students from our college who are good at drawing and art , and decided to draw and sell caricatures of those who paid them for that (rupees hundred for each caricature). 
									The team collected a total of Rupees one lakh three thousand seven hundred and seventy two(Rs.103772) and was entirely given to the CM's Disaster Relief Fund.
